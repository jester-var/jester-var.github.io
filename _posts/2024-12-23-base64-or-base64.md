Ho ho ho, Santa received this odd message from Skidmaster McGee! But... it's weird? Maybe it means something else?

with the text file,  **b64_or_b64_challenge.txt**

# Solution

## First Steps

In the text file there was a ton of base64 encrypted strings, so i went to **Cyberchef** to decode it.

The decoded text stated.

```
Hello, holiday hacker. I see you've found the power of CyberChef, but you'll never find my secret flag!

Put that in your juice box and sip it.

I am now going to monologue about Christmas and how it must be destroyed to prevent happiness and cheer from spreading!

Ah, Christmas. That pitiful relic of humanity's decadent past. Do you truly believe that amidst the endless toil and sacrifice required to sustain the Imperium, there is room for such frivolity? This so-called holiday is nothing but a distraction-a celebration of indulgence, idleness, and sentimentality, when only discipline and vigilance can ensure humanity's survival.

Christmas glorifies weakness. It preaches peace in a galaxy where peace does not and cannot exist. It extols forgiveness when such leniency invites treachery. Every bauble hung, every song sung, and every moment wasted on this hollow tradition steals time and effort better spent fortifying the Imperium.

I, who have sacrificed all to secure humanity's future, demand no gifts, no celebrations, no distractions. Your service, your loyalty, your unwavering dedication. That is all I require. Cast aside this nonsense and remember your purpose. The Imperium survives not through merriment, but through unyielding resolve.

I've noticed that the text was encrypted word by word and not as the whole  were is no flag here. So I did a research about the encryption.

P.S. Yea text is AI generated LMAO, idk why but it just is. Don't ask me, ask the host.


## Base64 Padding and how it can help with hiding information.


### Explanation 

Base64 uses 64 ASCII character set:
- **Uppercase letters**: A–Z
- **Lowercase letters**: a–z
- **Numbers**: 0–9
- **Symbols**:
- **Padding character** =

The way base64 works is by dividing the data by 6-bit chunks. But since most of the text is hidden in the 8-bit bytes, so sometimes bits don't divide evenly. To fix that, padding adds "=" signs.

Here's how it works:
- **If the input divides evenly into groups of 3 bytes (3n):** No padding is needed.
- **If there’s 1 leftover byte (3n+1):** It needs 4 extra bits of padding, shown as `==` in Base64.
- **If there are 2 leftover bytes (3n+2):** It needs 2 extra bits of padding, shown as `=`.

Padding bits are ignored during decoding base64, which helps use hide valuable information
### Example

As an example, Let's say that we want to Encrypt  `A`.
-  Binary for `A` would be `01000001`
-  Base64 will divide the binary by 6, which would give us `010000 01` . Since there's 01 left out, which is 2 bits, It needs a 4 bit padding (`==`)
-  Base64:  `QQ==` Binary: `010000010000` (first Q is `010000`, second Q and == `01 0000`)

Since Padding bits are ignored during decryption, we can put data in the last 4 bits. As an example we can write `010000010101` , which would be `QV==` but it would still output `A`. This way you can hide stuff in base64 using the padding.

## Final Steps

To not decode everything myself, I found an automated script specifically for this situation ([Link](https://github.com/RosinTheBow/stegano-b64-padding))

```
jstr $ python stegano-b64-padding.py  decode -p b64_or_b64_challenge.txt
