# CTF


QR codes are super handy! Heck, Santa has been using them to mark parts for his operations for years. This one is... weird, though. It's not like the others and was found on a box labled "Artifacts from Another Planet".

Picture:

# Solution

So first thing that I would like to say is that I didn't solve this ctf ðŸ˜­. Only thing that i did was the last two parts. this one will be more like a note for the future rather than a writeup. I got the the solution from one of the hosts (and also the person who made this ctf, Odyhibit)

As Odyhibit said, the Qr Code isn't a Qr Code. It infact is binary. This are the first two bits of all the letters. It forms rows of '01':

in the green square you can see white=0 black=1. It goes left to right top to bottom, like a zigzag:

After analyzing what Odyhibit explained, I wrote out the whole map:

(BTW I know it's ugly don't judge me pls)

After converting everything to binaries I got this string:

```binary
01110000 01110111 01101110 01111011 01100010 01101001 01111000 01010011 01011111
01100001 01101110 01100100 01011111 01100010 01111001 01110100 01100101 01110011
01011111 01100001 01101110 01100100 01011111 01110000 01101001 01111000 01100101 
01101100 01110011 01011111 01101111 01101000 01011111 01101101 01111001 01111101
```


Which translates to `pwn{bixS_and_bytes_and_pixels_oh_my}` . But that isn't the flag.

The thing is that the host made a small error and made mistakes with two binaries. the correct flag is `pwn{bits_and_bytes_and_pixels_oh_my}`
